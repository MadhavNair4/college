# A repository for College Projects and Assignments

Different projects and assignments from multiple faculties and courses are stored here. The repository is organized by the semester and course name. Each course has its own folder and each folder has its own README.md file with a description of the course and the projects and assignments that are stored in it.
Doesn't matter it matches the course name or not, the similar folder name is the course name.
If there is none of the courses you are looking for, you can create a new folder and add your projects and assignments there.
