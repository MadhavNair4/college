# Digital Logic

> Theory part covers topics like Digital Design Fundamentals and Boolean algebra, Combinational and Sequential Logic, Counters, Registers and Memory and Processor Logic Design

> This course is designed to help students understand the practical implementations of those thoeritical concepts taught in syllabus.

## How to Submit?

Inside the `[taskname]` folder, there is a `README.md` file that you will write, how the task was implemented. Code in any of `C, Go, Python, Java, C++, C#, JavaScript, PHP` extension file. You can follow this same format to submit your task.

-   Introduction to Question
-   Propose a solution
-   Explanation of the code
-   Output of the code `screenshots`.

When done, there should be two files in the `[taskname]` folder: `README.md` and the code file `[taskname].c` and any required pictures in the `assets` folder.

## Tasks

You're free to write in `C, Go, Python, C++, C#, JavaScript, PHP` as you prefer, once understood the concept, you can implement it in any language you like.

### Task 1: LogicSim

> LogicSim is a program that simulates the working of digital circuits. We've created a seperate [repository](https://github.com/b0sc/logicSim) for this task, where you can contribute to the project.

> You will visualize the working of digital circuits like AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR etc.
