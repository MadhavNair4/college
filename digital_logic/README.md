# Digital Logic

> Theory part covers topics like Digital Design Fundamentals and Boolean algebra, Combinational and Sequential Logic, Counters, Registers and Memory and Processor Logic Design

This course is designed to help students understand the practical implementations of those thoeritical concepts taught in syllabus.

## Task

-   [x] [LogicSim](https://github.com/b0sc/logicSim)

### LogicSim

LogicSim is a program that simulates the working of digital circuits. We've created a seperate [repository](https://github.com/b0sc/logicSim) for this task, where you can contribute to the project.

> You will visualize the working of digital circuits like AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR etc.
