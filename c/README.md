> Theory part covers topics like data types, operators, control structures, functions, arrays, pointers, strings, file handling, structures, and unions.

> This course is designed to help students understand the practical implementations of those thoeritical concepts taught in syllabus.

## How to Submit?

Inside the `[taskname]` folder, there is a `README.md` file that will contain how the task was implemented. Code in any of `C, Go, Python, Java, C++, C#, JavaScript, PHP` extension file. You can follow this same format to submit your task.

-   Introduction to Question
-   Propose a solution
-   Explanation of the code
-   Output of the code `screenshots`.

When done, there should be two files in the `[taskname]` folder: `README.md` and the code file `[taskname].c` and any required pictures in the `assets` folder.

## Tasks

You're free to write in `C, Go, Python, Java, C++, C#, JavaScript, PHP` or any other language you prefer, once understood the concept, you can implement it in any language you like.

### Task1: SQRT

Write a C program to calculate the square root of a number without using the sqrt() function from the math library. Instead, use an iterative method such as the Newton-Raphson method to approximate the result. Your program should include the following:

-   Handle special cases like negative numbers and 0.
-   Ensure the approximation continues until the result is accurate up to 6 decimal places.
-   Return the result of the square root calculation as a double.

This question challenges learners to apply concepts like loops, conditionals, functions, and arithmetic operations in C to achieve a mathematically correct result.
